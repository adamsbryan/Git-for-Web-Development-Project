Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Inline elements don't cause a line break and dont take up the full width of a page, ex being image <img>. Block elements start a new line and takes up the width of a page, ex being header tags <h1>
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
         The element doesn't move with the normal document flow and no space is created for the element in the page layout. Its final position is determined by the values of top, bottom, left, and right.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        Use padding
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        block: <div>, <h1> - <h6>, <p>
        inline: <a>, <span>
        inline-block: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        The box model adds a border around an element and defines space between elements. By default elements only have a small border around them where the content is. We can add padding, border or margin to them to make elements respect the width we've given them.
